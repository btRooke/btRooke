### üéì University Projects

All of these - probably around 40 - are stored on here. These range from lock-free lists in C to [_Kraken Arms_](https://btrooke.github.io/CS4102-practicals/partFour.html) in WebGL. I'll probably make these public in a year or two (2025) so no one comes after me!

In the meanwhile I'm planning to make a list of some here and such that if anyone needs to see them they can request access.
