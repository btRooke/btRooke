### ðŸŽ“ University Projects

The vast majority of the code I've written over the past 4 years has been for my university coursework projects.

All of these - probably around 40 - are stored on here. These range from lock-free lists in C to [_Kraken Arms_](https://btrooke.github.io/CS4102-practicals/partFour.html) in WebGL. I'll probably make these public in a year or two (2025) so no one comes after me!

In the meanwhile I'm planning to make a list of some here and if anyone would like access in the meanwhile I'd be happy to send them over.
