## 🌐 Profile Overview

This profile README is very much a work in progress but thought it might be nice to have for any people (or potential employers) to have an overview of what's going on around here.

### 🛠 University Projects

The vast majority of the code I've written over the past 4 years has been for my university coursework projects.

All of these - probably around 40 - are stored on here. These range from lock-free lists in C to _Kraken Arms_ in WebGL. I'll probably make these public in a year or two (2025) so no one comes after me!

In the meanwhile I'm planning to make a list of some here and if anyone would like access in the meanwhile I'd be happy to send them over.
